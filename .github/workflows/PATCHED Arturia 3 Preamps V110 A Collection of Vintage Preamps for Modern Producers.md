- Pre TridA: A rare and sought-after tube preamp that was designed by a legendary engineer and producer. It has a distinctive midrange presence and a silky high-end that can add sparkle and depth to your tracks.
- Pre V76: A German tube preamp that was widely used in broadcast and recording studios. It has a clean, transparent and detailed sound that can preserve the natural tone of your instruments and vocals.

Each preamp can be used in your DAW as a VST, VST3, AAX plug-in with a beautiful, high-res interface[^1^]. You can also mix and match them with other Arturia software effects to create your own custom signal chain. You can browse through hundreds of high-quality presets from award-winning sound designers, or tweak them to your liking with the intuitive controls.

Some of the other effects in this series include 3 Compressors You'll Actually Use, 3 Filters You'll Actually Use, and 3 Delays You'll Actually Use.
 
One of the main features of Arturia's software effects is the TAE technology, which stands for True Analog Emulation. This is a proprietary technology that uses advanced physical and circuit modeling to reproduce the behavior and characteristics of analog components and circuits. TAE technology allows Arturia to capture the subtle nuances and imperfections that make analog gear sound so unique and musical.
